The thing I'm particularly proud of in this assignment is the inclusion of a particle rain effect. This project doesn't have a ton in it, but a variety of other models I meticulously made by hand in OpenGL can be found within the house. 

Improvements made since the review:
Inclusion of Rain effect
Inclusion of Day/Night Cycle
Inclusion of Lamp Model
Inclusion of Sofa Model
Inclusion of Table Model
Inclusion of Bed Model
Fixed controls
